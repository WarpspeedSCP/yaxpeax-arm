## 0.0.3
`Instruction`, `Opcode`, and `Operand` are now a useful model of decoded
operations.
* `Operands`, plural, the enum of operands in the instruction, is now gone in
  favor of `Operand` that describe one operand of the instruction
* `Instruction` no longer include operand attributes like "add", "index", or "wback"
* better (not quite complete) support for non-user instructions and coprocessor instructions
* instructions operating on status registers through masks are now directly supported
* first brush of arm-version-specific decoder feature selection
* fix several preindex/postindex reversals
